This is an attempt to create regression tests for Doxygen, primarly for Fortran parser.
Under development..., the rules and the layout may change.

 RUNNING TESTS
It requires Python 2.5 and python-libxml2. Doxygen must be run with Doxyfile, which generates XML output to 'xml' directory. This directory MUST be cleaned (deleted) every time test suite is executed, otherwise there may be false positives.

In fortran directory run:
  doxygen Doxyfile
  ./test tests
to run all tests or for specific tests:
  ./test tests.blocks
  ./test tests.blocks.interface_op_f90

 WRITING TESTS
Place new Fortran file into one of the directories: syntax, blocks, linecont, or other. Update corresponding Python file in the 'tests' directory:
  - create test class that extends FortranTestCase
  - define checkXML() method
    - use self.getModule(name) to fetch libxml2 XML element instance for module
    - there is a set of predefined methods in FortranTestCase (base.py)
    - use elem.xpathEval("...") to fetch other elements
    - use self.assertTrue(), self.assertEqual(), ... to verify fetched values

XPath standard:

Check "2.5 Abbreviated Syntax" before writing your tests.
